## Introduction

This project focuses on solving the **Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP)** using a heuristic **NSGA-II** algorithm. FJSP is a well-known NP-hard problem that requires assigning operations to machines in a way that optimizes multiple conflicting objectives, such as **minimizing makespan**, **balancing load** and **total idle time** across machines.

The proposed method enhances the classic NSGA-II framework by integrating `hybrid initialization`, `adaptive crossover`, `local search`, and `kNN-based selection`, etc. to address multi-objective optimization in FJSP. The algorithm follows an evolutionary loop with several adaptive components:

The initial population is generated through a mixture of three strategies: 

- Heuristic generator that selects machines based on the shortest processing times.

- Chaotic generator introducing diversity via chaotic mapping.

- Standard random generator. 

This combination ensures a diverse and high-quality starting population.

Each generation proceeds with binary tournament selection to choose parents. The selected individuals are recombined using an adaptive crossover strategy that dynamically switches between `one-point crossover`, `uniform crossover`, and `processing-time-aware crossover` depending on the generation ratio. This ensures early exploration and later-stage exploitation. Mutation is performed via a local search module, which fine-tunes the offspring by reassigning operations to better-performing machines.

After generating the offspring, their fitness is evaluated using three objectives: `makespan`, `load balance`, and `total idle time`. The parent and offspring populations are merged and sorted using non-dominated sorting. For the last front where truncation is needed, the algorithm computes k-nearest neighbor (kNN)-based scores, which prioritize individuals contributing to diversity. In mid-generations, a hybrid weighting of diversity (via kNN) and convergence (via weighted objective sum) is applied adaptively.

An external archive is maintained throughout to store high-quality non-dominated solutions. It is updated each generation and pruned using crowding distance if its size exceeds the maximum limit.

**Core differences**

 Different ways of considering space:
- **Crowding distance:** Calculate on each target dimension separately and then sum
- **kNN:** Calculate Euclidean distance directly in the entire multi-target space

 Neighbor selection strategy:
- **Crowding distance:** Only consider directly adjacent individuals on each target
- **kNN:** Consider the k nearest neighbors in the entire target space

 Diversity sensitivity:
- **Crowding distance:** Give infinite values â€‹â€‹to boundary individuals, and intermediate individuals are based on adjacent distances
- **kNN:** All individuals are based on their local density, and the farther the distance, the higher the score


This modular design allows the algorithm to integrate multiple heuristics while maintaining flexibility in selection and replacement strategies. It is particularly aimed at enhancing solution diversity and incorporating practical scheduling heuristics into the NSGA-II framework.
